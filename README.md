# Open-Source-Auth

This is the main part of your Server! yay

This handles basic functions like:
- Announcments
- Help <-- might need changes depending on what commands you have in other scripts or this one
- Player Management
- Admin Management <-- you have to configure this in the script (you may do it in your server_config.xml file but this will add them automatically)
- And other Fun Stuff!
