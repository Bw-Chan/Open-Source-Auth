# Open-Source-Auth

This is the main part of your Server! yay

This handles basic functions like:
- Announcments
- Help <-- might need changes depending on what commands you have in other scripts or this one
- Player Management
- Admin Management <-- you have to configure this in the script (you may do it in your server_config.xml file but this will add them automatically)
- And other Fun Stuff!

## Lets get Started!

This is your the start of your config and you can replace all of that however you like.
It seems self explanitory so I wont explain it here.

These are your commands (including the vehicle manager I have made and the extras inculded with this script)
You can change these depending on what commands you add/change (make sure you keep this up to date it is quite important... duh!).
